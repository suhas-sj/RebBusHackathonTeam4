The objective of this project is to develop an application that can detect and identify objects in a live
camera stream, and send continuous data to a remote server with the image of the object and its
corresponding tag. The system should be designed to work in real-time, allowing for rapid detection and
classification of objects. The application must also provide a user-friendly interface to display the
identified objects and their tags in a web page.
The proposed system will utilize machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize objects in the
camera stream. The system will need to be trained on a large dataset of images to achieve high accuracy
and reliability in identifying objects. Once an object is identified, the system will send the image and tag
data to a remote server via a reliable data transfer protocol. The system must be designed to handle large
amounts of data transfer and ensure data integrity during transmission.
To display the identified objects and their tags in a web page, the system will require a user-friendly
interface. This interface should be easy to navigate and allow users to search for specific objects or view
all identified objects. The web page should display the image of the object and its corresponding tag in a
visually appealing manner, making it easy for users to quickly identify the object. Overall, the application
must be designed to meet the needs of users who require real-time object detection and classification
capabilities, while also providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.

contributions :
1) Aaron Jevil Nazareth and Suhas S Jogi :
Worked on the Android Application development , backend code for storing the image data , creating APIs for backend using flask , used MongoDB foe backend storage

2) Sounak Chakraborty : 
Worked on the Machine learning model and intergrating it with the Android application using flask APIs

3)  Kunal Pathak , Arpitha T and Harshitha :
Worked on the frontend of the web application to display the detected objects along with their tags using nodeJS
